                <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
                <p>To begin your journey in using Zorin OS, you will need to do a few things first:</p>
                <ul class="installation-list">
                  <li>Visit the <a href="https://zorin.com/os/" target="_blank">Zorin OS website</a> and click on "Download Zorin OS."</li>
                  <li>Scroll down and click on "Download" under the Zorin OS Core section.</li>
                  <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">Balena Etcher website</a> and click "Download" for your system.</li>
                  <li>Ensure you have a USB drive with at least 4GB of storage.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="download_buttons.png" alt="Download buttons" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once you have downloaded the ISO file you need to create a
                    bootable USB drive to have your computer boot into the Zorin OS. To do that you need to
                    flash the ISO file into the USB drive using the Balena
                    Etcher software.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="flash.png" alt="Flashing Process" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once you have successfully created the bootable USB using Balena Etcher, turn off your computer and boot into the BIOS or UEFI settings, 
                    typically by pressing keys like F2, F12, or Del when your computer starts. In the settings, navigate to the Boot menu and select your USB 
                    drive as the first boot device. Save your changes and exit; your computer should now boot directly from the Zorin OS USB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you are booting from your USB drive, you are first greeted by a welcome page with two options: 
                    "Try Zorin OS" and "Install Zorin OS." If you want to have a feel for Zorin OS before buying it, then you can simply choose "Try Zorin OS," 
                    and otherwise select "Install Zorin OS" to proceed immediately with the setup.

                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="try_zorin.png" alt="Try or install zorin Process" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Next, you will be prompted to choose your language, a specific keyboard layout, and network settings such that the computer 
                    is able to connect to the internet. After you have established these settings, you will select an installation option. For most users, 
                    "Erase disk and install Zorin OS" is ideal as it will provide you with a clean installation. But if you are an experienced user or you want 
                    to dual-boot another OS (e.g., Windows), select "Something else," and you will get to do your partitions by hand. It will then begin copying 
                    files to your hard drive. Meanwhile, you will get a chance to choose your geographical location for purposes of time-zones and to set up your user account, 
                    your username, password, and computer name.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="installation.png" alt="Installation Process" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    As soon as you complete the installation, you will be asked to restart your computer. 
                    Remove the USB drive while your computer is restarting to avoid booting in again. You will then greet the clean and 
                    welcoming Zorin OS login screen on booting again after the reboot.
