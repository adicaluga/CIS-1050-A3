                    user interface that is vastly Windows and macOS-like.

                    One of the most powerful strengths of Zorin OS is its ease of use.

                    feel incredibly at home immediately. At the same time, the complex options and enormous amount of customization possibilities 
                    can make it possible for anyone willing to go an extra step to tailor the system to their own workflow and needs.
